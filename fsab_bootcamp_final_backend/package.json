  "description": "## How to use this repo - Checkout to the branch of your choosing with `git checkout <branchName>` followed by `git pull`. If you're switching to a new branch, run `npm i`. To run the backend, run `npm start`.  - Branch options:     - `main` (default): Has almost nothing done for you, just the `.gitignore` file which helps you avoid committing files you don't want to!     - `express-boilerplate`: Sets up express for you.      - `firebase-template`: Sets up firebase for you, almost. You must navigate to `util/FirebaseInit.js` and replace the configuration values with the ones found in your Firebase Project settings. See the handout for more info!     - `complete`: The completed (most up-to-date) code, for your reference.",
